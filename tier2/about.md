# Tier 2: Machine Learning/AI

Welcome to Tier 2 of our Coding Bootcamp - Machine Learning/AI. This tier propels you into the captivating universe of machine learning and artificial intelligence, offering a comprehensive guide into:

- **[Machine Learning Basics](./Basics/main_lesson.md)**: Kickstart your journey into machine learning with an overview of its fundamental concepts. Learn about supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and clustering, along with the main algorithms used in these methods.

- **[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression](./KNN/main_lesson.md)**: Dive into the KNN algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that works on the principle of similarity measures, and explore the foundational Linear Regression technique. You'll delve into their workings, applications, and limitations.

- **[Decision Trees and Random Forests](./Trees_Forest/main_lesson.md)**: Understand the concept of decision trees and their ensemble version - Random Forests. You'll study their structure, working, and learn how they're used for both classification and regression tasks.

- **[Neural Networks](./Neural_Nets/main_lesson.md)**: Step into the realm of neural networks, the backbone of modern artificial intelligence. Understand their architecture, how they learn from data, and explore various types of neural networks.

- **[Explainable AI (XAI)](./XAI/main_lesson.md)**: Get acquainted with the concept of explainable AI, an emerging field aiming to address how AI models make decisions. Learn about feature importance, model interpretation, and techniques to make AI more transparent.

- **[Advanced AI Topics](./Advanced_Topics/main_lesson.md)**: Round off Tier 2 with advanced topics in AI such as transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. This will give you an expanded understanding of the AI field and its latest trends.

Each module will have a `main_lesson.md` file linking to individual lesson files, along with practice problems and homework assignments with solutions. This ensures that you thoroughly understand and apply these complex concepts. 

After going through all the modules and their associated assignments, it's time for you to apply everything you've learned into one capstone project:

- **[Personal Project](./personal_project/main_project.md)**: You'll work on a comprehensive project of your choosing that applies the concepts learned in this bootcamp. This is your chance to showcase your creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical proficiency. The project should involve aspects of coding, data analysis, and machine learning/AI to showcase the breadth and depth of your knowledge. You'll be provided with guidelines and support but the theme, data, and problem statement will be yours to choose.

Remember, AI is a rapidly evolving field - staying hands-on and up-to-date with the latest advancements is key to mastering it.
