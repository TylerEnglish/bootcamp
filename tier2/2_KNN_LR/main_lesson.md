# Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Lessons

Welcome to the Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors module. In this module, you'll start with the foundational Linear Regression technique followed by the exploration of the KNN algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification technique. Here's a brief overview:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Linear Regression](./lessons/lesson1.md): Dive into the basics of Linear Regression, understanding its principles and applications.

- [Lesson 2: Implementing Linear Regression](./lessons/lesson2.md): Get hands-on with Linear Regression, implementing it from scratch and using sklearn for more advanced applications.

- [Lesson 3: Evaluating and Improving Linear Regression Models](./lessons/lesson3.md): Learn how to assess the performance of your Linear Regression models and techniques to enhance their predictions.

- [Lesson 4: Introduction to KNN](./lessons/lesson4.md): Learn about the KNN algorithm, how it works, and its applications.

- [Lesson 5: Implementing KNN](./lessons/lesson5.md): Implement the KNN algorithm from scratch and learn how to use KNN with sklearn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

- [Lesson 6: Evaluating and Improving KNN](./lessons/lesson6.md): Understand how to evaluate the performance of a KNN model and explore techniques to improve it.
